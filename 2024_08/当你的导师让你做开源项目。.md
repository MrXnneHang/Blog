# So your teacher wants you to do open source 你的老师想让你做开源

*2024-03-31*

If your teacher (or tutorial/video/hackathon/etc) says "go do X in an open source project" and then sends you off unsupervised, they haven't adequately prepared you to be a contributor, or thought through the consequences of their assignment. Don't do it.
如果你的老师（或教程/视频/黑客马拉松等）说 "去开源项目中做 X"，然后就让你在无人监督的情况下离开，那么他们还没有让你做好成为贡献者的充分准备，也没有考虑到他们的任务会带来什么后果。不要这样做。

These teachers often have good intentions. They know projects need contributors. Open source projects can be high quality examples of how to structure and run larger/more complex code than a class can produce. They want their students to gain experience and help projects. However, they don't seem to know how to actually prepare their students to do this successfully. It tends to manifest in a few common types of interactions that aren't ultimately helpful and don't produce long lasting contributors.
这些教师往往用心良苦。他们知道项目需要贡献者。开放源代码项目可以成为高质量的范例，说明如何构造和运行比课堂教学更庞大/更复杂的代码。他们希望学生获得经验并帮助项目。然而，他们似乎并不知道如何让学生真正做好准备，成功地完成这项工作。这往往表现为几种常见的互动类型，这些互动最终并没有什么帮助，也不会产生长久的贡献。

Open source maintainers don't like dealing with these types of interactions. They don't have the time and mental energy to keep telling each person that comes by why it wasn't helpful. To each student it's a single assignment, but to each maintainer it's a relentless stream. It takes away from the limited resources they have to dedicate to do the actual things the project needs. We're happy to help interested new contributors, but don't start your open source journey with a bad impression.
开源维护者不喜欢处理这类互动。他们没有时间和精力去告诉每一个来访者为什么没有用。对每个学生来说，这只是一项作业，但对每个维护者来说，这却是源源不断的。这占用了他们有限的资源来做项目需要的实际工作。我们很乐意帮助有兴趣的新贡献者，但不要带着坏印象开始你的开源之旅。

Here are some of the types of interactions I deal with on a regular basis, and why they're not helpful.
以下是我经常遇到的一些互动类型，以及它们为什么没有帮助。

### Learning to use Git/GitHub 学习使用 Git/GitHub

Flask regularly gets PRs with a title like "Making a Change" or "Added a File". The assignment was clearly to learn how Git branching, commits, and GitHub PRs work. But instead of doing this in their own repository, they did it to a large public repository. The teacher may have told them to look at Flask earlier as an example, or to fork it and work on the fork only. But it resulted in a useless PR that notified every single person subscribed to the repository. And from the outside, not knowing it's an assignment, it looks like a random user trying to get their name into a popular project.
Flask 经常会收到标题为 "修改 "或 "添加文件 "的 PR。显然，他们的任务是学习 Git 分支、提交和 GitHub PR 的工作原理。但他们不是在自己的仓库里做，而是在一个大型公共仓库里做。老师可能会告诉他们以 Flask 为例，或者 fork 它，然后只在 fork 上工作。但这样做的结果是，一份无用的 PR 通知了所有订阅该版本库的人。从外面看，不知道这是个作业的人，会觉得这是个随意的用户想把自己的名字写进一个热门项目。

### Linters, Formatters, and Other Tools 分线器、成型器和其他工具

The student is learning about code and project quality tools, such as flake8, black, etc. They picked a tool, ran it with its default configuration, and submitted all the changes it made. "Improving Code Quality" is a common title for this PR. Except they forgot to check (or hadn't learned how to check) if a project is already using some tools, or different configurations for the tools.
学生正在学习代码和项目质量工具，如 flake8、black 等。他们挑选了一个工具，用默认配置运行了它，并提交了它所做的所有修改。"提高代码质量 "是这份公关报告的常见标题。只是他们忘了检查（或没学会如何检查）项目是否已经在使用某些工具，或工具的不同配置。

Most maintainers, especially of popular projects, are well aware of the different code quality tools out there, and either already set them up or deliberately don't want to use them. These tools can end up changing almost every line of every file in a project, something no maintainer would want to or even be able to review from a random first time contributor.
大多数维护者，尤其是流行项目的维护者，都非常了解各种代码质量工具，他们要么已经设置了这些工具，要么故意不想使用它们。这些工具最终可能会修改项目中每个文件的几乎每一行，而这是任何维护者都不愿意，甚至不可能从一个随机的首次贡献者那里审查到的。

Another form of this is running some generic security tool and just pasting its output as an issue. If you're going to report a security issue, first don't do it publicly, and second be sure you actually understand what you're reporting and if it's even applicable.
另一种形式是运行一些通用的安全工具，然后将其输出作为问题粘贴上去。如果要报告安全问题，首先不要公开报告，其次要确保自己真正了解报告的内容，以及是否适用。

A new form of this is "AI" (LLM) tools that claim to be able to improve something like documentation, tests, or performance, or identify security issues. These ones are good at making a report look "right" so it takes even more effort for maintainers to finally realize it's nothing.
一种新的形式是 "人工智能"（LLM）工具，它们声称能够改进文档、测试、性能或识别安全问题等。这些工具善于让报告看起来 "正确"，因此维护者需要付出更多努力才能最终意识到它什么都不是。

### Studies and Surveys 研究与调查

"My team at ABC University is doing a study about XYZ in open source. We somehow got your email, please fill out this survey." These emails are so annoying. First, how did you get my email, and how did your university possibly approve of using it in this way. Second, you're the 100th group to do a study about open source, and yet it seems that nothing has changed since the 1st group. Where are all the study results? Why hasn't anything been published, or anything changed because of it? Why do you keep asking the same 5 questions?
"我在 ABC 大学的团队正在做一项关于开源 XYZ 的研究。我们不知怎么收到了你的电子邮件，请填写这份调查问卷。"这些邮件太烦人了。首先，你们怎么会收到我的电子邮件，你们的大学又怎么会同意以这种方式使用我的电子邮件。其次，你们是第 100 个做开源研究的小组，但似乎从第 1 个小组开始就没有什么变化。所有的研究结果都在哪里？为什么没有发表任何文章，也没有任何改变？为什么你们总是问同样的 5 个问题？

### Saying Hello and Ghosting 打招呼和幽灵

This is a curious one that's come up on the official Python forum. A specific class at a specific university seems to be telling their students to sign up for the forums and say hello. The idea is probably that there are a lot of experienced Python people there for the students to ask questions and follow discussions. But what actually happens is that there is a category that is entirely made up of 100s of "Hello I'm ABC from XYZ University" topics from users that never interact with the forum again. It's just noise.
这是 Python 官方论坛上出现的一个奇怪的问题。某大学的某门课似乎在告诉他们的学生注册论坛并向他们问好。他们的想法可能是，那里有很多经验丰富的 Python 人员，学生们可以在那里提问并参与讨论。但实际情况是，有一个分类完全是由 100 多个 "你好，我是来自 XYZ 大学的 ABC "主题组成的，这些主题来自那些再也不与论坛互动的用户。这只是噪音。

Another way I see this manifest is people joining the Flask/Pallets Discord server to say "Hello, I'm new to open source, how can I contribute." One of our moderators has a good friendly response they post each time, detailing what in the ecosystem needs attention, here's how to find issues, etc. But after this / other answers are given, the users never return.
我看到的另一种表现形式是，人们加入 Flask/Pallets Discord 服务器，说 "你好，我是开源新手，我该如何贡献自己的力量"。我们的一位版主每次都会发布一个友好的回复，详细说明生态系统中哪些方面需要关注、如何发现问题等。但在给出这样或那样的答复后，用户就再也不会回来了。

Users also like to say "I'll work on this" on issues, but then never actually seem to work on it. I delete those comments when I come across them weeks later, so that other users don't think the issue is "taken". There's no need to ask to work on an issue. Just check that there's not an open PR already, ask questions if you need more details, and do it.
用户还喜欢在问题上说 "我会解决这个问题"，但似乎从来没有真正解决过。几周后，当我遇到这些评论时，我会将其删除，以免其他用户认为该问题已被 "处理"。没有必要要求就某个问题开展工作。只需检查是否已经有一个公开的 PR，如果需要更多细节，可以提问，然后去做。

### Code Reviews 代码评论

Unfortunately, GitHub lets anyone leave code reviews on PRs, regardless of if they're a maintainer or existing contibutor. Sure, we can disable the "approve" and "reject" review types, but that still leaves the "comment" type that essentially looks and acts the same. If you're not familiar with a project, you're probably not in a position to review changes to it effectively. From the PR author's perspective, one review looks like another, so they have no idea this one isn't authoritative and might spend a bunch of time responding and reworking things before an actual maintainer notices.
不幸的是，GitHub 允许任何人在 PR 上留下代码评论，无论他们是维护者还是现有的贡献者。当然，我们可以禁用 "批准 "和 "拒绝 "两种审查类型，但仍然会留下 "评论 "类型，这种类型在外观和行为上都是一样的。如果你对一个项目不熟悉，你可能无法有效地审核对它的修改。从公关作者的角度来看，一个审查看起来和另一个审查一样，所以他们根本不知道这个审查不具有权威性，可能会在真正的维护者注意到之前花费大量时间进行回复和返工。

------

A lot of these fall into the category of "we didn't ask for this", where instead of doing something the project explicitly asked for, the student did something their assignment asked for instead. When maintainers see these things hundreds of times, they lose patience. We know the student is doing it for an assignment, and is not actually going to stick around after the class is over. We don't want to invest our limited time in that.
其中很多都属于 "我们没有要求这样做 "的情况，即学生没有做项目明确要求做的事情，而是做了他们的作业要求做的事情。当维护人员数百次看到这种情况时，他们就会失去耐心。我们知道学生这样做是为了完成作业，实际上并不会在下课后继续留下来。我们不想把有限的时间投入其中。

This is not your fault as a student. It's your teacher's fault for not preparing you better. If you actually are interested in becoming a regular contributor to an open source project, that's great, and we have resources to help you get started. Find a project that interests you, not necessarily the big popular one but maybe one of its dependencies that gets less attention. Look for a contributing guide in the project, look at open issues that don't have an open PR, observe how other successful contributions were done. Take your time, stick around, and you'll learn plenty.
这不是你作为学生的错。是你的老师的错，因为他没有为你做更好的准备。如果你真的有兴趣成为开源项目的定期贡献者，那很好，我们有资源可以帮助你开始。找一个你感兴趣的项目，不一定是大热门项目，也可能是关注度较低的依赖项目。在项目中寻找贡献指南，查看没有开放 PR 的开放问题，观察其他成功贡献是如何完成的。慢慢来，坚持下去，你会学到很多。
